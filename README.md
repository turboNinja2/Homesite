24th place solution

Requirements :
- Keras
- XGBoost

Simply download the data from Kaggle and run _run.bat on a windows machine. 

This is a simple blend of xgboost models and keras models. The nice ranking is mainly due to the golden feature found during the competition (see the exploration section ;) ).

I also gave a try to the r nnet and glmnet packages, without success.
